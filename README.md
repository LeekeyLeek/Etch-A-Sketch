This is a project I used to practice manipulating HTML and CSS through DOM Manipulation. 

The goal of this project is to let you draw on a sketchpad with multiple different colors. You can resize the sketchpad to allow for more or less detail when drawing,and you can clear the pad of anything you previously drew.

To open this project, open the etch.html file in your browser.
