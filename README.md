This is a project I used to practice manipulating HTML and CSS through JavaScript's DOM manipulation capabilities. 

The goal of this project is to let you draw on a pixelated sketchpad with multiple different colors. You can resize the sketchpad to allow for more or less detail when drawing, and you can clear the pad of anything you previously drew.

When resizing the pad, you'll input a number below 100 and the program will resize the grid for you. For example, entering "64" would create a 64x64 grid to draw on.
